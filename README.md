Pipeline for APOGEE spectra using Marginalized Analytic Dataspace Gaussian Inference for Component Separation (MADGICS).

## Installation

This is a pipeline. Not a package. It is not really meant to be installed. The pipeline.jl script is meant to be run. This repo documents the development and versions of the pipeline for transparency and reproducibility.

If you wish to download the code and have the dependencies required to run it installed, you can install directly from GitHub. 

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/andrew-saydjari/apMADGICS.jl")
```
